# Iris Flower Classification

This Python code is designed to demonstrate how to train and compare various machine learning classifiers for the task of Iris flower classification. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of sepals and petals of three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You also need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

- `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

Once the dependencies are installed, you can execute the Python script `iris_classification.py`.

## Usage

Run the `iris_classification.py` script using Python:


This will load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train multiple classifiers (including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes), evaluate their performance, and compare their accuracies using a bar plot.

## File Structure

- `iris_classification.py`: The main Python script containing the code for loading the dataset, training classifiers, and comparing their performance.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and other relevant information.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It is included in the scikit-learn library and can also be found in various other sources online.

## Results

The comparison of classification methods (accuracy) is displayed both in the console output and visually using a bar plot.
