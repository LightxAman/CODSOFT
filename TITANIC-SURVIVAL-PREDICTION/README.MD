# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset often used in beginner machine learning projects due to its availability and historical significance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about individual passengers onboard the Titanic, including:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and feature scaling if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of features, correlations, and any patterns that may emerge.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance.
7. Final Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
