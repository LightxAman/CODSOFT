# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on building a model to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. This project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques to provide insights into the factors influencing movie ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about movies, including features such as:
- Genre: Genre(s) of the movie
- Director: Director(s) of the movie
- Actors: Main actors in the movie
- Rating: Rating given to the movie
- Others: Additional features like year, duration, etc. may also be included

## Methodology
1. Data Loading: Load the dataset containing movie information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform any necessary feature scaling.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of features, correlations, and any patterns in the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: Utilize regression techniques to build a model that predicts movie ratings based on the provided features.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
7. Visualization: Visualize the predicted vs actual ratings and other relevant insights from the data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
The results from the code, including model evaluation metrics and visualizations, are available in the "results" sub-directory.
